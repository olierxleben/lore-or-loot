## A Dungeon, like many before
### Goblin Trader

On a dirty burlap sack, spread on some wood crates, there are some wares on display.
A little green creature looks at you with a mixture of suspicion and greed.

A door leads back to the [ðŸšªentry hall](entry).

<Shop
    client:load
    stock={ [
        {
            name: "Sword",
            price: 5,
            amount: 1
        },
        {
            name: "Health Potion",
            price: 2,
            amount: 5
        }
    ] }
